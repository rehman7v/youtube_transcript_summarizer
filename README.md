# youtube_transcript_summarizer
A YouTube Transcript Summarizer is a tool that extracts and summarizes video transcripts, making it easier to understand long videos quickly.

Key Features:
Transcript Extraction – Retrieves the transcript using YouTube API or third-party tools.
Text Processing – Cleans and structures the transcript for better readability.
Summarization – Uses AI (Natural Language Processing - NLP) to extract key points.
Multiple Summary Modes – Provides short, detailed, or bullet-point summaries.
Multi-Language Support – Works with transcripts in different languages.

Technologies Used:
Python (YouTube API, NLP libraries like spaCy, NLTK, GPT-4, or BERT)
Web Scraping (if API is unavailable, using Selenium/BeautifulSoup)
AI Summarization (TextRank, OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face Transformers)
Web UI (Flask, FastAPI, or React for a frontend interface)

How It Works:
User enters a YouTube video URL.
The tool fetches the auto-generated or manual transcript.
The transcript is processed and cleaned (removing timestamps, filler words).
AI/NLP algorithms generate a summarized version.
The user downloads or views the summary in different formats.
